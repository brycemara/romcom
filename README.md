# ROMCOM

[Bryce Jarrett](https://github.com/brycemara) Paired-turn-Solo Project ; mod1

### Description:
  This application allows you to generate randomized RomCom covers, as well as create some of your own. You can save random covers you like, as well as save covers you create.

### Usage:
  - Open [this link](file:///Users/brycemarajarrett/romcom/index.html) to be directed to the website.
  - Generate random covers by clicking the "Show New Random Cover" button.
  - Save covers you like use the "Save Cover" button.
  - Create your own cover by clicking the "Make Your Own Cover" button and enter an image address, title, and tagline's. You can also save your created cover.

### Timeline:
  Over the course of the week I followed the iterations provided by Turing. I made steady progress and completed Iteration 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.

### Resources:
  For this project I used Github to clone the repository. Then I worked locally on different branches to complete the iterations. Each iteration has a branch, i.e. feature-iteration-one has all my iteration 1 progress. I used Atom as my text editor. Resources I used to complete this application were MDN, classmates, and my mentor.

### Final Outcome:
The first feature on this website is generating a random cover by clicking the "Show New Random Cover" button.

The second feature creating your own cover using the "Make Your Own Cover" button.

Lastly, you can save covers (including your own creations) and view them on their own page clicking the "View Saved Covers" button. Be careful, you can't delete them once they've been added!
